# video360


## WAT?

Plays and allows controlling and displaying:
* cubemap videos such as those [served by facebook](facebook.com/Facebook360),
* equirectangular videos such as those [served by youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?filters=spherical&lclk=spherical).



## Limitations

you must use a server which streams the video with ranged requests and CORS

[shameless plug](https://github.com/JosePedroDias/dwarf-media-server)



## TODO

* alternate ways of controlling the video
    * mouse (current)
    * gyro
    * keys
    * API only
* UI
    * sliders for time and volume working
