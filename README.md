# cubemap-video


## WAT?

Plays and allows controlling cubemaps videos such as those [served by facebook](facebook.com/Facebook360).


## you must use a server which streams the video with ranged requests and CORS

[shameless plug](https://github.com/JosePedroDias/dwarf-media-server)


## TODO

* fix autoplay for mobile
* alternate ways of controlling the video
    * mouse (current)
    * gyro
    * keys
    * API only
* enrich demo with video controls
